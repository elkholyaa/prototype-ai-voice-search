## Testing Philosophy and Best Practices

### The Right Approach to Test Fixes
1. **Tests as Validation Tools, Not Goals**
   - Tests are meant to validate that our application works correctly
   - Tests should not drive the application design; they verify it
   - Never modify application logic just to make tests pass
   - Failed tests indicate potential issues in either:
     * The application logic that needs proper fixing
     * The test cases that need alignment with actual requirements
     * The test environment setup

2. **When Tests Fail**
   - First, understand why the test is failing
   - Review if the failure indicates a real problem in the application
   - Fix the underlying issue in the application logic if there is one
   - Only modify tests if they don't accurately reflect the requirements
   - Never "hack" the application code just to make tests pass

3. **Test Case Design**
   - Test cases should reflect real-world usage
   - Include edge cases and error conditions
   - Tests should be maintainable and clear about what they're validating
   - Focus on testing behavior and outcomes, not implementation details

### Current Test Improvements
- Natural language variations in test queries
- Support for spelling mistakes and variations
- Mixed formal/informal Arabic expressions
- Flexible validation for semantic search results
- Real-world feature descriptions
