# AI Voice Search - Development Session

## Session Initialization Prompt
Use this prompt to start a new development session:

"Please review the project overview, features, tech stack, and documentation before proceeding. Specifically:

1. Review SESSION.md which shows:
   - Current project state and scope (Arabic voice search POC)
   - Implemented features (voice processing, filtering, RTL)
   - Tech stack compatibility (Next.js 14.0.4, TypeScript 5.3.3, React 18.2.0)
   - Active development areas
   - Development guidelines

2. Check CHANGELOG.md for recent changes (v0.2.0)

3. Verify README.md for:
   - Setup instructions
   - Project structure
   - Development process
   - Browser requirements

After reviewing these, please confirm your understanding and we can proceed with development tasks."

## Session Checklist
Before proceeding with development:
1. Review project scope: Arabic voice search POC for real estate
2. Understand key features implemented:
   - Voice input processing (upcoming)
   - Property filtering
   - RTL/Arabic support
3. Check tech stack compatibility:
   - Next.js 14.0.4 features

## Project Overview
Proof of concept for Arabic voice search in real estate listings using OpenAI's natural language processing.

## Current State
- Fully functional NLP-based search implementation
- Advanced Arabic query processing
- Property filtering system
- RTL and Arabic support with Noto Kufi Arabic font
- Sample Saudi Arabian property data
- Latest stable dependencies
- Optimized image loading with proper container styling
- Test structure in place:
  - Global tests in src/__tests__/
  - Component-specific tests in src/utils/__tests__/

## Active Development Areas
- Voice recognition implementation
- OpenAI integration
- Search parameter extraction optimization
- Property filtering refinement
- UI/UX improvements

## Next Steps
1. Implement OpenAI embeddings-based search
   - Set up OpenAI API integration
   - Implement text embedding generation
   - Create vector similarity search
2. Add voice input processing
   - Implement Web Speech API
   - Add voice-to-text conversion
3. Enhance property filtering
   - Combine embeddings with traditional filters
   - Optimize search performance
4. Add comprehensive testing
   - Unit tests for search functionality
   - Integration tests for API calls
   - End-to-end testing for voice features

## Technical Stack
