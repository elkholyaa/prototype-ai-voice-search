# AI Voice Search - Development Session

## Session Initialization Prompt
Use this prompt to start a new development session:

"Please review the project overview, features, tech stack, and documentation before proceeding. Specifically:

1. Review SESSION.md which shows:
   - Current project state and scope (Arabic voice search POC)
   - Implemented features (voice processing, filtering, RTL)
   - Tech stack compatibility (Next.js 14.0.4, TypeScript 5.3.3, React 18.2.0)
   - Active development areas
   - Development guidelines

2. Check CHANGELOG.md for recent changes (v0.2.0)

3. Verify README.md for:
   - Setup instructions
   - Project structure
   - Development process
   - Browser requirements

After reviewing these, please confirm your understanding and we can proceed with development tasks."
